## Toxic Comment Classification
* Using train.csv dataset (originated from https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) to help classify whether a comment is toxic or not
* Creating a toxic words dictionary from a list of negatively connotated words (negative-words.txt) (originated from https://gist.github.com/mkulakowski2/4289441) and profanity (profanity-words.txt) (originated from https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt)
